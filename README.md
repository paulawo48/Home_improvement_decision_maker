# Home_improvement_decision_maker
Python and Data Science Project

This project focuses on using python and jupyter notebook to predict house prices based on extracted Zoopla Data before comparing the data with the cost of home improvement to determine the most best improvement to increase the property value regardless of the time needed to implement the project.

It uses a python script to webscrap the desired data from the Zoopla seachpage, using beautiful soup, before reading the data into a CSV table.

The jupter notebook then uses pandas, numpy and matplotlib to describe and analyse the csv datafile before using different Machine learning models to find the best predictor of house prices.
